# My sycl Training

This repo holds some usage examples of SYCL, CUDA and another
tools developed for heterogeneous computing. It is focused on
doing the binding with main code in Fortran.

## Cases
- `C_case` : Main function in C, sum of vectors in C.
- `C_Fort_case` : Main function in Fortran, sum of vectors in C.
- `C_sycl_case` : Main function on C++, sum of vectors in Sycl.
- `Fort_sycl_case` : Main function on Fortran, sum of vectors in Sycl.
